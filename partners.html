		<p>Welcome to the Protecting Water Mapper, where users can quickly and intuitively explore data and analyses that underpin The Nature Conservancy&#39;s 
			global-scale reports, <a href='https://global.nature.org/content/beyond-the-source' target='_blank'>Beyond the Source: The Environmental, Economic and 
			Community Benefits of Source Water Protection</a> (forthcoming, January 2017), and <a href='https://global.nature.org/content/water-share' target='_blank'>
			Water Share: Using Water Markets and Impact Investment to Drive Sustainability</a> (September 2016). This mapping site is part of a large and growing 
			family of spatial decision tools supported through the <a href='http://coastalresilience.org/natural-solutions/toolkit/' target='_blank'>Natural Solutions 
			Toolkit</a>. The Toolkit connects and coordinates multiple related programs and decision support tools that all advance the use of nature-based solutions 
			that can reduce risk, advance climate change adaptation and mitigation and provide other benefits.

		<p>The lands around our water sources serve as vital water infrastructure for cities around the world. These lands collect, store and filter our water, and when 
			managed well, can provide a number of additional benefits to people and nature. <span class='ital'>Beyond the Source</span> seeks to illustrate how nature-based 
			solutions, such as forest protection, reforestation and improved agricultural practices, can be implemented at a scale that will make a visible difference in our 
			collective pursuit to create a sustainable world and improve the lives of billions of people.  
		</p>
		<p><span class='ital'>Beyond the Source</span> analyzes source watersheds of more than 4,000 large cities around the world, and finds that four out of five cities 
			can reduce sediment and nutrient pollution by a meaningful amount through forest protection, reforestation and improved agricultural practices, thus improving 
			water quality and quantity. These natural infrastructure solutions also provide a number of co-benefits, including improving the health and livelihoods of people 
			living in cities and rural areas, preserving plant and animal biodiversity, trapping and storing carbon dioxide emissions and building more resilient communities 
			in the face of climate change. The research highlights water funds as a successful mechanism for downstream water users to fund upstream land conservation and 
			restoration, securing improved water quality and supplies in return. An analysis of the cost for implementing source water protection activities shows that one in 
			six cities could recoup the costs through savings in water treatment alone. Other cities can place a value on the co-benefits and &#34;stack&#34; the total value 
			to realize a positive return on investment.

		<p class='bld'>Water Share</p>
		<p><span class='ital'>Water Share</span> explores the potential for water markets and impact investment to serve as part of the solution to global water scarcity. 
			The premise is straightforward: today, nearly half of all people are affected by global water scarcity, and climate change will further exacerbate our water challenges. 
			At least 37 countries in water-scarce regions have already established water allocation systems based on the issuance of water rights—these countries are potential 
			candidates for impact investment-driven solutions through water markets. The report explores how enabling private actors to intervene on behalf of the environment 
			and marginalized communities, water markets offer a powerful mechanism for alleviating scarcity, restoring ecosystems, and driving sustainable water management.

		<p class='bld'>Protecting Water Atlas functions</p>
		<p class='under'>Water Benefits Explorer</p>
		<p>Investing in watersheds produces a range of benefits and contributes to addressing other social, economic and ecological challenges in addition to water security. 
			The Watershed Benefits Explorer app allows users to see where  investments may achieve the most co-benefits for people and nature. The app allows users to identify 
			watersheds that meet user-defined criteria related to biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and human health and well-being, as an aid in prioritizing 
			investment and action.  . The app also enables users to select individual watersheds and view more detailed information about what co-benefits may, or may not, be 
			enhanced by investments in that watershed.
		</p>
		<p class='under'>Water Funds Explorer</p>
		<p>Water funds are a source water protection mechanism for sharing the benefits of healthy watersheds across communities.  Water funds have four common characteristics: 
			science-based plans, a multi-stakeholder approach, a funding mechanism and implementation capacity. The Water Funds Explorer allows users to explore where current water 
			funds have been established, to learn about their key attributes, and to query across different water funds to to learn the approaches and attributes various funds have 
			in common.

		<p class='under'>Water Security Explorer (Coming Soon)</p>
		<p>Investing in watershed health is a sustainable way to help achieve water security.  With the Water Security Explorer, a user will be able to identify (1) where 
			sub-watersheds are of greatest importance for downstream drinking water, (2) where communities can reach user-defined water pollution reduction targets, and (3) what 
			would be required to reach these targets in terms of area and cost.  In addition, the app will explore carbon mitigation potential.

		<p class='under'>Water Share Explorer (Coming Soon)</p>
		<p>Innovative investments can help to address water depletion. The Water Share app leverages WaterGAP3 depletion levels over various temporal scales and sectors to provide 
			users with an exploratory tool to look at how, where and when water has been used in a given basin. In addition, this app will allow users to integrate some of the 
			&#34;conditions&#34; developed in the <span class='ital'>Water Share</span> report regarding potential strategies to alleviate scarcity within a given basin depending on 
			its depletion assessment. Finally, case studies will provide a more in-depth story of the social and environmental effects of depletion at the basin level.
