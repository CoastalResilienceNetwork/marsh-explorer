		<p>Welcome to the Protecting Water Mapper, where users can quickly and intuitively explore data and analyses that underpin The Nature Conservancy&#39;s global-scale reports, 
			<a href='https://global.nature.org/content/beyond-the-source' target='_blank'>Beyond the Source: The Environmental, Economic and Community Benefits of Source Water 
				Protection</a> (forthcoming, January 2017), and <a href='https://global.nature.org/content/water-share' target='_blank'> Water Share: Using Water Markets and Impact 
				Investment to Drive Sustainability</a> (September 2016). This mapping site is part of a large and growing family of spatial decision tools supported through the
				<a href='http://coastalresilience.org/natural-solutions/toolkit/' target='_blank'>Natural Solutions Toolkit</a>. 
		</p>  
		<p><span class='bld'>Beyond the Source</span> illustrates how nature-based solutions can help create a sustainable world and improve the lives of billions of people. From analysis of source 
				watersheds of more than 4,000 large cities around the world, Beyond the Source finds that four out of five cities can improve water quality and quantity and provide 
				a variety of other benefits through forest protection, reforestation and improved agricultural practices. The report highlights water funds as a successful mechanism 
				for downstream water users to fund upstream land conservation and restoration, securing improved water quality and water supplies and other benefits in return. 
		</p>
		<p><span class='bld'>Water Share</span> explores the potential for water markets and impact investment to enhance global water scarcity. Today, nearly half of all people are affected by 
			global water scarcity, and climate change will further exacerbate our water challenges. The report explores how water markets offer a powerful mechanism for alleviating scarcity, 
			restoring ecosystems, and driving sustainable water management.

		<p><img src='img/benefits.png'><span class='under'>Benefits Explorer</span>: Investing in watersheds produces a range of benefits and contributes to addressing other social, economic and 
			ecological challenges in addition to water security. The <span class='bld'>Benefits Explorer</span> app allows users to see where investments may achieve the most co-benefits for 
			people and nature.	
		</p>
		<p><img src='img/waterFunds.png'><span class='under'>Water Funds Explorer</span>: Water funds are a source water protection mechanism for sharing the benefits of healthy watersheds across communities. 
			<span class='bld'>The Water Funds Explorer</span> app allows users to 
			explore where water funds have been established, to learn about their key attributes, and to query across different water funds to learn the approaches and attributes 
			various funds have in common.
		</p>	
		<p><img src='img/waterSecurity.png'><span class='under'>Water Security Explorer (Coming Soon)</span>: Investing in watershed health is a sustainable way to help achieve water security. With the 
			<span class='bld'>Water Security Explorer</span>, a user will be able to identify (1) where sub-watersheds are of greatest importance for downstream drinking water, (2) where 
			communities can reach user-defined water pollution reduction targets, and (3) what would be required to reach these targets in terms of area and cost.
		</p>	
		<p><img src='img/waterShare.png'><span class='under'>Water Share Explorer (Coming Soon)</span>: 
		Innovative investments can help address water depletion. The <span class='bld'>Water Share</span> app enables users to look at how, where and when water has been used and explore potential 
		strategies to alleviate scarcity within a given basin.
