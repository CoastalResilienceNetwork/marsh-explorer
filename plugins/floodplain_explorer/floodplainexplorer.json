					"help": "Floodplains have an important role in the supply of sediment and large woody debris to river networks through bank erosion and avulsions. Floodplains only act as a proximate source of sediment, storing material derived from headwater streams and hillslopes. Thus, floodplains supply sediment if they are composed of erodible material; a river can access that material during floods, has sufficient power to transport the material, and if there are upstream sources of sediment that can replenish floodplain stores of sediment. In addition to these conditions, floodplains supply wood to rivers only when they have mature forests. Channel banks with revetments protecting infrastructure and areas covered with impervious surfaces generally do not supply sediment or wood to channels.",

The HAZUS model was run using a USGS-derived high floodplain depth grid to generate building loss estimates expected for the largest flood event. Initial results are reported by census block. In order to downscale these data and generate loss estimates for the floodplain segments, the percentage of each census block within a floodplain unit was calculated and only that proportion of the original total loss value was reported for each floodplain segment. It is important to note that there are uncertainties inherent in any loss estimation technique. <a href='xml/PG_HazusMethods.xml'target='blank'<b>Metadata</b><a>",
